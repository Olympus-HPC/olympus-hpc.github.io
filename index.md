title: Olympus-HPC
---

Olympus-HPC is an open-source ecosystem for research and development in compiler and runtime systems for HPC and accelerators.

The ecosystem includes **Proteus** (LLVM-based JIT compilation) and **Mneme** (record–replay and performance experimentation).

## Projects

- **[Proteus](https://olympus-hpc.github.io/proteus/)** — LLVM-based JIT compilation engine.
- **[Mneme](https://olympus-hpc.github.io/Mneme/)** — Record–replay for GPU kernels.

## Tutorial and Presentations 

**Tutorial @[CGO 2026](https://2026.cgo.org/)** *Quick guide on internals on both Proteus and Mneme* [slides](/assets/talks/cgo-2026-tutorial.pdf)
